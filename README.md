# Call for Customized Conversation: Customized Conversation Grounding Persona and Knowledge

Source codes for the baseline models of **[Call for Customized Conversation: Customized Conversation Grounding Persona and Knowledge](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.08619)**, accepted at AAAI-22.



### Environment Setting
We trained the models under the setting of torch==1.5.0, transformers==4.5.0, tensorboardX==2.1, etc.

We exploited [pytorch-ignite](https://github.com/pytorch/ignite) from pytorch.

Please see **requirements.txt** file for more information.


### Dataset [**[FoCus dataset v2](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1bHqYj-tWgd0i1Wnst-bJ30lYrmRwTPd-/view?usp=sharing)**]
This data is the modified version of the original data (which is reported in the paper) after ethical inspection.

We put train, valid, test files of the dataset in the **data** folder. (The test set will be available after March 2022.)

You should create directories named **infer_log_focus, train_log_focus, test_log_focus, models** under FoCus folder.

The project directory should follow this directory structure:

    ðŸ“¦FoCus
    â”£ ðŸ“‚data
    â”ƒ â”— ðŸ“œtrain.json
    â”ƒ â”— ðŸ“œvalid.json
    â”£ ðŸ“‚ignite
    â”£ ðŸ“‚infer_log_focus
    â”£ ðŸ“‚models
    â”£ ðŸ“‚python_tf_idf
    â”£ ðŸ“‚test_log_focus
    â”£ ðŸ“‚train_log_focus
    â”£ ðŸ“œclassification_modules.py
    â”£ ðŸ“œdata_utils.py
    â”£ ðŸ“œevaluate_test.py
    â”£ ðŸ“œevaluate_test_ppl.py

    â”£ ðŸ“œinference_test.py
    â”£ ðŸ“œLICENSE
    â”£ ðŸ“œREADME.md
    â”£ ðŸ“œrequirements.txt
    â”£ ðŸ“œtest.sh
    â”£ ðŸ“œtrain.sh
    â”£ ðŸ“œtrain_focus.py
    â”— ðŸ“œutils_focus


### Training the models
Uncomment the command to start training the model in the **train.sh** file. (Please uncomment the lines in the shell file that you want to run.)

    sh train.sh 


### Evaluation
Uncomment the command in the **test.sh** file, to evaluate the model on the test-set. (Please uncomment the lines in the shell file that you want to run.)

    sh test.sh


### Inference
Uncomment the command of the **inference.sh** file, to generate utterances with the trained models. (Please uncomment the lines in the shell file that you want to run.)

    sh inference.sh


### Evaluate the submitted results from the leaderboard. Please specify the file name as an argument 'file_name'. We made a fake result file and used it.
    CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=? python evaluation_leaderboard.py

The submitted files should include 6 generated machine's utterance per one dialog, and persona_pred with bool expression, knowledge_pred with integer (0-9) for each utterance.
The result files should follow the format below:

    {"data": [{"persona_pred": [false, false, true, true, false], "knowledge_pred": 8, "machine_utt_0": ["It's the Museum of History and Industry, you love museum."], "dialog_ID": "JLG63YRTYNF3"}, {"persona_pred": [false, false, true, true, false], "knowledge_pred": 8, "machine_utt_1": ["It's the Museum of History and Industry, you love museum."], "dialog_ID": "JLG63YRTYNF3"}, {"persona_pred": [false, false, true, true, false], "knowledge_pred": 8, "machine_utt_2": ["It's the Museum of History and Industry, you love museum."], "dialog_ID": "JLG63YRTYNF3"}, {"persona_pred": [false, false, true, true, false], "knowledge_pred": 8, "machine_utt_3": ["It's the Museum of History and Industry, you love museum."], "dialog_ID": "JLG63YRTYNF3"}, {"persona_pred": [false, false, true, true, false], "knowledge_pred": 8, "machine_utt_4": ["It's the Museum of History and Industry, you love museum."], "dialog_ID": "JLG63YRTYNF3"}, {"persona_pred": [false, false, true, true, false], "knowledge_pred": 8, "machine_utt_5": ["It's the Museum of History and Industry, you love museum."], "dialog_ID": "JLG63YRTYNF3"}, ... ]}

### Join Our Workshop @ [COLING 2022](https://coling2022.org/)
We are going to hold **[the 1st workshop on Customized Chat Grounding Persona and Knowledge](https://sites.google.com/view/persona-knowledge-workshop)** in Octorber 2022.
Stay tuned for our latest updates!
